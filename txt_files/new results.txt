new results:

phase contrast omnipose data (is it valid to compare results from the actual LR segmentations to HR segmentations?
	is the linear upsample a more valid comparison given the number of pixels can affect IoU indirectly? also since
	for the upsampled images they are compared to the 100x actual masks instead of downsampled masks does this make 
	them more valid results?)

superres trial 1 (linear)

superres trial 2 (cubic)  (did linear vs cubic actually make a difference? doubtful but should be tested with linear again just in case)

test on real data

next steps:
do again with realistic images (hopefully collected very soon) for PC (also with Fl)

think - do we actually expect SR to improve performance far beyond what just segmentation can do - both networks would be provided
	with similar information via training data - very difficult inputs with clear outputs

SRCNN at very least is very quick to train compared to omnipose (due to simplicity) - maybe main benefit could be from the speedup of 
	training if it turns out that asymptotic results are similar (ie quickly train SR to 100x level then train omnipose for x epochs, 
	which might outperform omnipose at (5+)x epochs from the low res image) - should investigate this behaviour over epochs 
	trained (up to 4000+) (current results are sup 500 epochs mostly, 200 for trial 2)
