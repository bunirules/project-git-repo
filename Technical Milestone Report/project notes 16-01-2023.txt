- add the triangle next to figure 1
- remove some detail from fig 3 just long arrow left to right
- figure 4 orient pictures so mm is same way
- figure 5: get rid of top left panel and bottom right, mention in text
that iou and segmentation are similar tho not the same so other two 
plots are bigger

- show some synthetic images, will collect real data at various objectives 
to compare to symbac images to make them more realistic and refine camera 
model etc say that images have room to be improved in this way.

- maybe merge the two bits of fig 5 and fig 6 into one

- check for mask sizes - are errors coming from not enough blurring or what
